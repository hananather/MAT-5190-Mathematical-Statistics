\subsection{methods of evaluating estimators (continued)}
The general topic of evaluating statistical procedures is part of a branch of statistics called decision theory. In this section we look at some basic criteria for evaluating estimators.
    
\begin{definition}[Mean square error (MSE)]
    The \vocab{mean square error} of an estimator $W$ of a parameter $\theta$ is the function of $\theta$ defined by $\EE_{\theta}(W-\theta)^2$.
\end{definition}
