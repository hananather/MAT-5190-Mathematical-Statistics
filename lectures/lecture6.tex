\section{September 27, 2021}
In this section we are going to consider events that \textit{co-occur}, and revisit concepts such as \textit{independence} and \textit{conditional probability}. We will learn how to handle random variables that co-occur.
\subsection{Joint and Marginal Distributions}
What is the most important information about a random variable? The PMF, or the PDF. The multivariate analogue to the \vocab{Joint function}, which takes in a value of two or more random variables, and returns the probability that those two variables jointly take on those values.
$$
\PP(X =x, Y=y) \quad \text{Joint Probability of $X$ and $Y$}
$$
Should be read a: ``Probability $X$ takes on the value $x$ and $Y$ takes on the value $y$".
\begin{definition}[Joint probability table]
 A joint probability table is a way of specifying the "joint" probability distribution between two random variables.
