\subsection{Equivariance Principle}
\textbf{Equivariance Principle:} If $\boldsymbol{Y} = g(\boldsymbol{X})$ is a change of measurement scale such that the model for $\boldsymbol{Y}$ has the same formal structure as the model for $\boldsymbol{X}$,  then inference procedure should be both measurement equivariant and formally equivariant.
