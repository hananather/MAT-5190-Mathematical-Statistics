\subsection{Location and Scale Families}
In this lecture we discussed three techniques for constructing families of distributions. Each of these technique relies on first specifying a single pdf,
$f(z)$, called the \textit{standard pdf} for the family. The other pdf's in the family are generated by applying a certain transformation to the standard pdf. 

\begin{theorem}
    Let $f(z)$ be any odf and $\mu$ and $\sigma >0$ be arbitrary constants. Then the following function is also a pdf:
    $$
    g(x|\mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma}f \left ( 
    \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
    \right )
    $$
\end{theorem}
The family $\{ f(x-\mu): - \infty < \mu < \infty \}$ is called a \term{location family} with a standard pdf $f(z)$. The location parameter $\mu$ shifts the graph $f(z)$ with $\mu$, with out changing its shape.\\
\\
\vocab{Representation:} Let $Z$ be a random variable with pdf $f(z)$ and $X = \mu + Z$. Then the pdf of $X$ is $g(x|\mu)$. If $F_z(z)$ and $F_x(x)$ are cdf's of $Z$, respectively $X$, then
$$
F_X(x) = F_z(x-\mu).
$$
\vocab{Uniform location family.} By taking $f(z)$ be a uniform $U(a,b)$ pdf, we generate the following location family:
$$
g(x|\mu) = \frac{1}{b-a}, \quad a+\mu < x < b + \mu
$$
\vocab{Exponential location family.} By taking $f(z)$ to be Exponential($\beta$) pdf ($\beta$ is a fixed value), we generate the following location family
$$
g(x|\mu) = \frac{1}{\beta}e^{-(x-\mu)/\beta}, \quad \mu <x< \infty
$$
