\subsection{Location and Scale Families}
In this lecture we discussed three techniques for constructing families of distributions. Each of these technique relies on first specifying a single pdf,
$f(z)$, called the \textit{standard pdf} for the family. The other pdf's in the family are generated by applying a certain transformation to the standard pdf. 

\begin{theorem}
    Let $f(z)$ be any odf and $\mu$ and $\sigma >0$ be arbitrary constants. Then the following function is also a pdf:
    $$
    g(x|\mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma}f \left ( 
    \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
    \right )
    $$
\end{theorem}
The family $\{ f(x-\mu): - \infty < \mu < \infty \}$ is called a \term{location family} with a standard pdf $f(z)$. The location parameter $\mu$ shifts the graph $f(z)$ with $\mu$, with out changing its shape.\\
\\
\vocab{Representation:} Let $Z$ be a random variable with pdf $f(z)$ and $X = \mu + Z$. Then the pdf of $X$ is $g(x|\mu)$. If $F_z(z)$ and $F_x(x)$ are cdf's of $Z$, respectively $X$, then
$$
F_X(x) = F_z(x-\mu).
$$
\vocab{Uniform location family.} By taking $f(z)$ be a uniform $U(a,b)$ pdf, we generate the following location family:
$$
g(x|\mu) = \frac{1}{b-a}, \quad a+\mu < x < b + \mu
$$
\vocab{Exponential location family.} By taking $f(z)$ to be Exponential($\beta$) pdf ($\beta$ is a fixed value), we generate the following location family
$$
g(x|\mu) = \frac{1}{\beta}e^{-(x-\mu)/\beta}, \quad \mu <x< \infty
$$
\subsection{Scale Families}
The family $\{ (1/ \simga)f(x/ \sigma): 0 < \sigma < \infty \}$ is called a \term{scale family} with standard pdf $f(z)$.
\\ \\
A scale parameter $\sigma > 1$ stretches the graph with pdf $f(z)$ without changing its basic shape. Similarly a scale parameter $\sigma < 1$ contracts the graph of $f(z)$. 
\\\\
\vocab{Representation:} Let $Z$ be a random variable with $f(z)$ and $X = \sigma Z$. Then the pdf of $X$ is $g(x|\sigma) = (1/\sigma)f(x/\sigma)$. If $F_Z(z)$ and $F_x(x)$ are the cdf's of $Z$ and $X$,  respectively, then
$$
F_X(x) = F_Z \left( \frac{x}{\sigma} \right).
$$

\begin{note}
    \vocab{Gamma Scale Family}. By taking $f(z)$ be the pdf of Gamma$(\alpha,1)$, (where $\alpha$ is fixed), we generate the following scale family
    $$
    g(x|\sigma) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\sigma^{\alpha}}x^{\alpha-1}e^{-x/\sigma}, \quad 0 < x < \infty
    $$
    \vocab{Double Exponential.} By taking $f(z)$ as the pdf of Double Exponential(0,$\simga$), we generate the following scale family
    $$
    g(x|\sigma) = \frac{1}{2\simga}e^{-\abs{x}/\sigma}, \quad -\infty < x < \infty
    $$
\end{note}

\subsection{Location-scale families}
The following family of distributions 
$\{ (1/ \sigma)f(x-\mu)/ \sigma): -\infty < \mu < \infty, 0 < \sigma < \infty$ \}
is called \term{location-scale family} with standard pdf $f(z)$.
\\ \\
Let $Z$ be a random variable with pdf $f(z)$ and $X = \mu + \sigma Z$. 
Then pdf of random variable $X$ is given by $(1/\sigma)f(x-\mu)/\sigma)$. If $F_Z(z)$ and $F_X(x)$ are the cdf's of $Z$ are the cdf's of $Z$ and $X$, respectively, then
$$
F_X(x) = F_Z \left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \right)
$$
Therefore, clearly we have
$$
\EE X = \mu + \sigma \EE Z, \quad \VV ar X = \sigma^2 \VV ar Z
$$
Generally, the standard pdf $f(z)$ is chosen in such a way that $\EE Z = 0$ and $\VV ar Z = 1$, this results in $\EE X = \mu$ and $\VV ar X = \sigma$.
